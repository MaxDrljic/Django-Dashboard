# Django-Dashboard

Django-based project which holds three applications and one main application. In this project, I implemented CRUD functionality, web scraping, API functionality and used Plotly and Dash to implement graphs and statistics.

To use the project properly, all apps should be in the src/ folder, and outside of src, you should have media_root folder where the API will store images which we are getting from the https://www.theonion.com/.

Also, you need to setup your server, Python and Django instance.

Enjoy!
